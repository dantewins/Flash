        "back": "A measure of how much a trait's variation is explained by genetic factors. It is often expressed as a percentage. For example, if the heritability of intelligence is 50%, it means that 50% of the variation in intelligence can be explained by genetic factors."

        "back": "An effect that explains the increase in IQ scores over time. It is named after James Flynn, who discovered that IQ scores have been rising steadily over the past century. This effect is thought to be due to environmental factors, such as improved education and nutrition."
