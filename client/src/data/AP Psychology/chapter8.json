        "front": "Representativeness heuristic",
        "back": "A mental shortcut that involves judging the likelihood of things in terms of how well they seem to represent, or match, particular prototypes.

        "front": "Sunk-cost fallacy",
        "back": "When people continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money, or effort).

        "back": "The tendency to approach a problem in a particular way, often a way that has been successful in the past. For example, if you have always solved math problems using a certain method, you might be reluctant to try a new method even if it would be more efficient."

        "front": "Functional fixedness",

        "front": "Framing",
        "back": "The idea that the same information can be presented in different ways, leading to different interpretations. For example, if a surgery has a 90% success rate, it might be framed as '90% of patients survive' or '10% of patients die,' which could lead to different emotional reactions."

        "front": "Divergent thinking",
        "back": "Thinking that searches for multiple possible answers to a question. For example, if you are brainstorming ideas for a project, you might use divergent thinking to come up with many different possibilities."
